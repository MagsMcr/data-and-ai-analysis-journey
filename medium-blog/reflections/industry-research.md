### Main Topic:
Education experts testified before an MPs' inquiry regarding the decline in children reading for pleasure in the UK, making four recommendations to address the problem.

### Key Points:
- Children's reading for pleasure has declined in UK schools
- MPs are conducting a formal inquiry into this issue
- Education experts recommend giving reading for pleasure a **higher profile** within the school curriculum
- The inquiry suggests parliamentary-level recognition that reading enjoyment (not just proficiency) matters for educational outcomes
- Policy changes are needed to address declining engagement with reading

### Relevance:
This addresses a UK education policy concern about literacy engagement beyond just technical reading ability. Potential implications for data analysis and EdTech include:
- Student engagement tracking systems
- Library usage data analysis
- Reading intervention programs
- EdTech tools that promote reading pleasure vs. purely instructional reading tools

**Date:** Published 3rd June 2025 (Updated 12th June 2025)  
**Report Type:** Annual Survey Report

### Main Topic:
Annual Literacy Survey findings from 114,970 children and young people aged 5-18 in early 2025, examining reading enjoyment, frequency, and motivation across demographics.

### Key Points:

**Reading Enjoyment Crisis:**
- Only **1 in 3 (32.7%)** children aged 8-18 enjoy reading in their free time - **lowest in 20 years**
- 36% decrease in reading enjoyment since 2005
- Steepest decline in past year: primary-aged children and boys (especially ages 11-16)

**Reading Frequency Decline:**
- Fewer than **1 in 5 (18.7%)** 8-18 year-olds read daily in free time - **lowest ever recorded**
- Daily reading down nearly 20 percentage points since 2005
- Even ages 5-8 dropped to 44.5% daily reading (down 9.1 points since 2019)
- Gender gap widening: girls read more than boys (6.2 percentage point gap - largest since 2023)
- Socio-economic gap: 19.4% non-FSM vs 15.8% FSM students read daily

**What Motivates Young Readers (Ages 8-18):**
- 38.1% - Material related to favourite film/TV series
- 37.1% - Content matching interests/hobbies
- 30.9% - Interesting book covers/titles
- 26.6% - Freedom to choose what to read

**Low-Enjoyment Readers:**
- Nearly half still recognize reading helps learn new words/things
- Still engage with: song lyrics, news articles, fiction, comics, fan fiction
- Need reading aligned with personal interests and cultural media

### Relevance:
**Critical data source** for understanding UK literacy crisis. Directly connects to Tes article on reading pleasure decline. This survey methodology and dataset would be highly relevant for:
- Data analyst roles in education sector
- Understanding large-scale survey data collection (114,970+ responses)
- Educational outcomes analysis
- Student engagement metrics
- Policy-driven research approaches

**Author:** Shoaib Raza (senior international leader)

### Main Topic:
The rise of AI means children today don't just need to know how to use technology – they need to know when to use it. The article argues that schools must shift from teaching digital literacy to teaching digital maturity.

### Key Points:
- **Digital literacy vs Digital maturity:** Digital literacy focuses on HOW to use technology, while digital maturity focuses on WHEN to use it
- **AI context:** The proliferation of AI tools makes this shift critical - students need judgment and decision-making skills, not just technical skills
- **Educational imperative:** Schools must evolve their digital education approach to prepare students for AI-rich environments
- **Senior leadership perspective:** Written by an international education leader, suggesting this is a strategic priority at institutional level

### Relevance to My Field:

**For Data Analysis in Education:**
- This represents a shift in what schools will measure and track - not just technology usage but quality of decision-making around technology use
- Potential for analytics around student decision-making patterns with AI tools
- New KPIs emerging: digital maturity metrics vs. traditional digital literacy metrics

**For AI Strategy Roles:**
- Confirms education sector is actively thinking about AI integration strategically
- "Digital maturity" could become a key framework for AI product development in EdTech
- Opportunity to develop assessment tools or analytics dashboards measuring digital maturity

**For Job Search:**
- Language to use in applications: "digital maturity," not just "digital literacy"
- Shows UK education sector is forward-thinking about AI
- Validates focus on education sector for AI strategy roles

### Follow-up Questions to Explore:
- How would schools measure "digital maturity"? (Data opportunity!)
- What metrics distinguish mature vs immature digital decision-making?
- Are there existing frameworks/assessments for digital maturity in education?
