# Data Analysis & AI Career Development Journey

**Building technical foundations in data analysis and AI strategy**

Business Development → Data Analyst → AI Strategy & Product roles

*Started: January 2026 | Target sectors: Education & Publishing*

**GitHub:** MagsMcr | **Tech Stack:** Python, R, SQL, pandas, matplotlib | **Learning:** DataCamp, Kaggle, practical projects

## 🎯 Featured Portfolio Projects

### 1. Food Choices & Nutrition Analysis
**Focus:** Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, demographic patterns  
**Dataset:** 125 college students, 61 variables (Kaggle)  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib

Analyzed nutrition knowledge and eating behaviors among college students, investigating:
- Calorie estimation accuracy across demographic groups
- Relationship between exercise frequency and food choices
- Self-reporting bias in health behavior surveys

**Key finding:** Zero students reported "never exercising" despite anonymous survey, revealing systematic self-reporting bias in health behavior data.

### 2. Student Dropout Analysis (OULAD)
**Focus:** Data joins, filtering patterns, engagement analysis  
**Dataset:** 32,593 Open University students across multiple courses  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, statistical exploration

Examined student unregistration patterns to identify:
- Timing of dropout decisions (early vs. late semester)
- Courses with highest dropout rates
- Demographic patterns among students who unregister
- Engagement differences between dropouts who submitted assessments vs. those who didn't

**Analytical approach:** Semi-joins and anti-joins to compare student cohorts, multiple sequential merges across demographic and assessment data.

### 3. Education Publishing Analysis
**Focus:** Data creation, aggregation, business metrics  
**Dataset:** Simulated book orders across 8 schools, 3 quarters  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, DataFrame creation

Created and analyzed fictional education publishing dataset demonstrating:
- Revenue analysis by region and genre
- Budget utilization patterns across schools
- Quarterly sales trends and forecasting
- Custom aggregation functions for business KPIs

**Context:** Designed to demonstrate pandas skills (Chapters 1-4) in education sector context relevant to target roles.

## 💡 Learning Approach

**Systematic skill building** through structured curriculum (DataCamp) combined with applied projects using real datasets.

**Transparent AI collaboration:** All projects document AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic). Code is written or reviewed by me, with AI used for guidance, syntax support, and methodological discussion. This approach reflects how I'll work with AI tools in professional roles.

**Public learning:** Documenting the complete journey from business development professional to data analyst, maintaining daily GitHub commits and comprehensive project documentation.
