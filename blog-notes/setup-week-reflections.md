### Time: [4 hours]

### Notes on AI
- Had issues with the chat randomly lagging despite the fact that it was not too long and I was noweher near the response limit
- Definitely feeling like it provides me with extra accountability - even though I am only talking to "the machine" it still helps when I am reporting my progress and need to help for help at a specific time 
- Still need to work on the prompt generation, specifically whwen it comes to techincal help. I have neglected alternating between different chats for different purposes and I need to revisit this idea tomorrow. This is due to the fact that Claude keeps defaulting into provodong solutions in a moment to the very latest prompt, speciifcally when it comes to troubleshooting. It does not intuitively account for previous responses to allow smooth work flow, it has to be directed.
- It seems to be defualting into time saving solutions rather than more in depth, sustainable solutions. Recommended to just keepo using VS Code Inisders even thought the full version is the better option. Then recommended abandoning attempts to solve the issue of lack of communication between VS code and Python and finding a manual workaround to the task at hand even though more sustainable option was to solving the issue for smooth workflow later. 
- it just had a hiccup when wriitng a code for the github commit - and i know i should be doing this mysef but we are on day 2 and i am tired. It incorrectly provided the GitHUb location path. two points here:
  -  it clearly didn't know it, it assumed
  - The knowledge should have transfered from another chat within the project as yesterday the code was correct. But it did not
