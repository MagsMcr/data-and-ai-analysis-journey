# Setup Week Learning Notes
Started: January 19, 2026

## Day 1 - Monday Jan 19
### Morning accomplishments:
- Git and GitHub set up! ✓
- First repository created ✓
- Python environment configured ✓
- VS Code set up ✓

### What I learned today:
- Terminal navigation (pwd, cd, ls, mkdir)
- Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Virtual environments keep projects separate
- Import statements load Python libraries
- [will add more after DataCamp session]

### Afternoon accomplishments:
- DataCamp Intermediate Python Chapter 1 (Matplotlib) completed ✓
- Learned about basic plotting with matplotlib
- Understanding line plots, scatter plots, and customization

### What I learned today:
- **Terminal Navigation:** pwd (where am I), cd (change directory), ls (list contents), mkdir (make directory)
- **Git Workflow:** The three-step process - add (stage), commit (snapshot), push (upload to GitHub)
- **Virtual Environments:** Keep project dependencies separate - like separate toolboxes for different projects
- **Python Imports:** Loading libraries with import statements (import pandas as pd)
- **Directories vs Folders:** Proper technical term is "directory" in terminal/coding contexts
- **Commit Messages:** Each commit needs a unique message describing what changed - like email subject lines
- **Matplotlib/pyplot:** pyplot is a module inside matplotlib - already installed when I installed matplotlib

### Challenges faced:
- Initially confused about whether I had VS Code installed (it was there!)
- Understanding the difference between local changes and GitHub (local = my computer, GitHub = cloud backup)
- Git authentication - learned about Personal Access Tokens
- Realizing that file edits UPDATE the same file, not create new ones

### Aha moments:
- Git commits are like snapshots/save points in time, not folders!
- The (career_env) in terminal means my virtual environment is active
- I can work in Terminal OR VS Code terminal - they access the same things
- PATH means "where the computer looks for programs"
- When I push to GitHub, my local files don't change because they already HAVE the changes

### Technical terms I learned:
- Repository (repo): Project directory tracked by Git
- Commit: Saved snapshot with message
- Push: Upload to GitHub
- Clone: Download repo from GitHub to computer
- Stage: Prepare files for commit (git add)
- Virtual environment: Isolated Python setup for a project
- Directory: Technical term for folder

### Tools now configured:
- Git (version control)
- GitHub account (MagsMcr)
- Python 3.11.5
- Virtual environment (career_env)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter, scikit-learn
- VS Code with Python extension

### GitHub commits today: 3
1. Initial repository structure
2. Python environment test
3. Day 1 learning notes

### Thougts on AI
1. So far enjoying wokring wiht Claude
2. Need to streamline my ability to set its tone and look into its sustainability - Claude keeps dropping techincal spec of communication 
3. Beware of the errors - took 4 attempts for it to fix the documents to display the correct dates on the planning documents 

### Time spent: ~6.5 hours (extended due to late start)

### Tomorrow's focus:
- R and RStudio installation
- Git practice
- DataCamp Chapter 2
- Python practice scripts (moved from today)
